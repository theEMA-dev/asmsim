# ASMsim: 32 Bit MIPS Simulator

![Banner](img/banner.png "Image of the ASMsim Application's UI")

**ASMsim** is a real-time simulator for 32 bit MIPS assembly code developed as part of a Computer Organization course project. This educational tool helps students understand MIPS assembly programming concepts while earning course credit through hands-on experience with assembly language simulation.
